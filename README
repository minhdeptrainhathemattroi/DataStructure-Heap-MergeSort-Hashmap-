Comments: So I did all the things passed however I was using gap of your test. In Iterator, I do next and hasNext by
checking Pair and if the Pair is not equal to Pair that I'm iterating, I will move to next Pair. However, When I reach
to the second Pair (I forgot to keep tracking the iterable), its never reach to the third Pair in same bucket since it will
return back to the first Pair. I didn't check it but I think it will be wrong as I predict. I didn't have plenty time since
I spent one week to move my apt.
