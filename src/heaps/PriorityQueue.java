 * A Priority Queue is a kind of queue where every element has a priority,

 * are always removed first. We will be using Integers as priorities.
 *
 * In this Priority Queue implementation, the internal ordering of elements
 * of equal priority is arbitrary. In other words, elements inserted with
 * equal priority are not necessarily removed in FIFO order. We only need
 * to guarantee that the highest priority elements are removed before lower
 * priority elements.
 *
 * @param <T> The type of the elements stored in the queue.
